CSV Data Cleaning Project

A mini-project using Python and Pandas to clean messy CSV data. It handles missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and invalid entries, transforming raw data into a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis or further processing.

📂 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical data cleaning and preprocessing skills, essential for data engineering and data analysis. The dataset contains messy entries like missing values, inconsistent formatting, duplicates, and errors. The goal is to produce a clean dataset ready for analysis.

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

🔹 Steps Taken

Data Inspection – Loaded the CSV and explored columns, missing values, and data types.

Column Standardization – Cleaned column names for consistency.

Handle Invalid Entries – Replaced errors like "ERROR" or "UNKNOWN" with NaN.

Data Type Conversion – Converted strings to numeric types and parsed dates.

Missing Values – Filled or handled missing data for numeric and categorical columns.

Duplicates Removal – Identified and removed duplicate rows.

Text Normalization – Stripped whitespace, standardized casing, fixed typos.

Validation & Export – Checked final dataset and saved a cleaned CSV file.

📊 Before & After

Before: Messy dataset with missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicates.

After: Cleaned dataset ready for analysis or reporting.
